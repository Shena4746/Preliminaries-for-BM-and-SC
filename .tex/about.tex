This is a set of solutions to the selected exercises in Chapter 1 of the book\cite{bmsc:Karatzas-Shreve} by Ioannis Karatzas and Steven E. Shreve. All statements of the exercises in this document are borrowed from the book, and the solutions are taken from the presentation material I used in a seminar. Any suggestions for improvement would be appreciated.
