# About This Document

This is a set of solutions to the selected exercises in Chapter 1 of the book ["Brownian Motion and Stochastic Calculus, second edition"](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-0949-2) by Ioannis Karatzas and Steven E. Shreve.

All statements of the exercises in this document are borrowed from the book, and the solutions are taken from the presentation material I used in a seminar. Any suggestions for improvement would be appreciated.
